README (24 Nov 2013)

Inputs:
- the directory where the library (libWCSimRoot.so) resides is assumed to be in the above directory (../libWCSimRoot.so) unless the WCSIMDIR environment variable, that defines the directory where the WCSIM package is, is set.
- the input root file is assumed to be ../wcsim.root, unless it is given as argument to the macro.

Note: there are two arguments in sample_readfile.C, one is the root file and the other it's verbose (true or false). Verbose is false by default.

Files:
read_number_of_PMTs.C
read_PMT.C
sample_readfile.C
